            Excellent Classes has been catering to the S.S.C. students from the past 30 years and producing spectacular results. We are also imparting education to post S.S.C. students in XI, XII (Science and Commerce) for undergraduate programs. With changing times and parents opting for CBSE Board for their children, we have ventured into imparting education for CBSE Board. We understand that a different board requires a set of teachers with unique skills and a different mindset of the management. We have a dedicated team of teachers with vast relevant experience to cater the needs of our CBSE students.
